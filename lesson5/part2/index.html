            <h2>On Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p>The common practice is testing a website in multiple resolutions
                and adding more and more media queries to fix the issues that arise.
                However, every media query adds overhead to future CSS changes, and
                they should not be added lightly. Here are a few more tips to avoid
                needless media queries:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use percentages or viewport-relative units instead of fixed widths.</li>
                <li>When you want a fixed width for larger resolutions, use max-width, not width.</li>
                <li>When using multi-column text, specify column-width instead of column-count,
                    so that you get</li>
                <li>When you want a fixed width for larger resolutions, use max-width, not width.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="third">
            <h2>Use shorthands wisely</h2>
            <p>You could of course try to set all the longhands and call it a day,
                but then you might forget some. Or the CSS WG might introduce more
                long- hands in the future, and your code will have failed to reset
                those. Donâ€™t be afraid of shorthands. It is good defensive coding
                and future-proofing to use them, unless we intentionally want to
                use cascaded properties for everything else.</p>
